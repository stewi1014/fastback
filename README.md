# FastBack
*Fast, incremental Minecraft world backups powered by Git*

Fastback is a Minecraft mod that backs up your world in incremental snapshots.  When it does a backup,
it only saves the parts of your world that changed.

This means backups are fast.  It also means you can keep snapshots of your world without using up a lot
of disk space.
